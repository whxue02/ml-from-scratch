## Features

- **Neural Networks:**  
  - Implemented a fully connected **feedforward neural network** from scratch using **NumPy**, supporting multiple hidden layers and ReLU activations.  
  - Developed **forward and backward propagation** with gradient descent optimization and Mean Squared Error loss, training the network on a weather dataset to predict next-day temperatures.  
  - Included **data preprocessing** (standard scaling, train/validation/test splits) and mini-batch training, demonstrating end-to-end understanding of neural network training pipelines.  


- **Decision Trees:**  
  - Implemented a **decision tree classifier from scratch** in Python, supporting multi-feature splits and recursive tree growth.  
  - Included **information gain-based splitting**, entropy calculations, and stopping conditions for leaf creation and maximum depth.  
  - Demonstrated end-to-end usage with real datasets (e.g., **Breast Cancer dataset**), achieving over 92% accuracy, showcasing practical understanding of model training and evaluation.  

- **Logistic & Linear Regression:**  
  - Implemented **Linear Regression from scratch** using the closed-form solution (Normal Equation) in Python and NumPy, achieving **RÂ² = 0.87** on predicting Olympic medal counts.  
  - Built a **Logistic Regression classifier from scratch** with gradient descent and sigmoid activation, trained and tested on the **Breast Cancer dataset**, achieving ~89% accuracy.  
  - Designed both models for **educational clarity**, demonstrating hands-on understanding of regression principles, parameter updates, and evaluation metrics.
